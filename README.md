# Mediocre Mario World

Super Mario remade in C++.

## Prerequisites

- **CMake ≥ 3.21**
- **A C++ compiler and an IDE with CMake support**,
- **SFML 2.6.x**: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/

I've run the program on Windows, Linux and MacOS. Remember to point your IDE to your SFML 2 installation, and set the working directory to the project root.
